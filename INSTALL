The installation procedure is
	1. ./configure
	2. make
	3. su -c "make install"

If you can't be root, use '--prefix=' option when running configure.

To build ripperX, you need GTK2 >= 2.6, Glib >= 2.6, and gettext >= 0.15.
You will also need id3lib (http://id3lib.sourceforge.net/)

If you have autoconf >= 2.60 and recent versions of automake and libtool,
you can re-libtoolize the build environment by using autogen.sh, which
will run configure for you.

You will need cdparanoia to rip digital audio from your CD-ROM. You can
get the latest version at http://www.xiph.org/paranoia/index.html
(Hint: Use the -d option to spec your cdrom drive.)

You will also need one of the supported OGG, FLAC, or MP3 encoders. 

Well, that's all. Have fun.
