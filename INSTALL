The installation procedure is
	1. ./configure
	2. make
	3. su -c "make install"

If you can't be root, use '--prefix=' option when running configure.

To build ripperX, you need gtk. You can get current version of gtk at
www.gtk.org.  You also need id3lib (http://id3lib.sourceforge.net/)

You will need cdparanoia to rip digital audio from your CD-ROM. You can
get the latest version at http://www.xiph.org/paranoia/index.html
(Hint: Use the -d option to spec your cdrom drive.)

You will also need one of the supported mp3 or ogg encoders. 

Well, that's all. Have fun.
