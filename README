ripperX is a graphical interface to CD rippers and MP3/OGG/FLAC encoders.
It is released under the GNU GPL. 
For more information please read the COPYING file.

=====================================================================

If you have any suggestions or bug reports, please mail us at:

Tony Mancill <tmancill@users.sourceforge.net>
  and/or
Dave Cinege <dcinege@psychosis.com>

Note that we're anticipating bugs, and hence more frequent releases.
Therefore, release numbering will be 2.7.x to indicate bugfix/patch
releases between functionality releases (i.e. 2.7 -> 2.8).

Also of note is that primary development is being done on Debian now,
not RedHat, so we welcome input from other distro users on how to make 
life easier for them in order to accomodate them as much as possible.

Have fun.

Note: jos.dehaes@bigfoot.com no longer maintains ripperX
