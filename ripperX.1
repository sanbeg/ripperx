ripperX \(em graphical (GTK) frontend for ripping and OGG/FLAC/MP3 encoding CD tracks 
.SH "SYNOPSIS" 
.PP 
\fBripperX\fR 
.SH "DESCRIPTION" 
.PP 
This manual page documents briefly the 
\fBripperX\fR command. 
.PP 
This manual page was written for the \fBDebian GNU/Linux\fP distribution 
because the original program does not have a manual page. 
 
.PP 
\fBripperX\fR is an X-based program that uses   
\fBcdparanoia\fR to convert (i.e. "rip") CD audio tracks to 
WAV files, and then calls the Vorbis/Ogg encoder 
\fBoggenc\fR to convert the WAV to an OGG file.  
It can also call \fBflac\fR to perform loss-less compression  
on the WAV file, resulting in a FLAC file. 
 
Alternately, if you have an MP3 encoder installed such as \fBtoolame\fR     \fBlame\fR or \fBbladeenc\fR, it can then  
convert the WAV into a MP3 file. 
.PP 
Besides a nice GUI interface, \fBripperX\fR also 
supports CDDB queries to retrieve song and album information, progress 
meters, and pausing while ripping. 
.SH "OPTIONS" 
.PP 
This program takes no command line arguments.  After starting the 
application, select the \fIConfig\fP button and cycle through 
the tabs to learn what options are configurable. 
 
.PP 
Because Vorbis/Ogg uses variable bit rates, there is not a direct 
correlation between the bitrate selected for encoding and the rate used by 
\fBoggenc\fR.  Instead, the bitrates in 
\fBripperX\fR are mapped to the quality modes (1-6) supported by 
\fBoggenc\fR.  Bitrates 56, 64, 96 == mode 1, 112 and 128 == 
mode 2, 160 == mode 3 (the default), 192 == mode 4, 256 == mode 6, and 320 
== mode 6. 
.PP 
The FLAC encoding currently does not accept any bitrate arguments to adjust  
the compression/speed settings, so whatever bitrate you select in the config dialog 
will be ignored for this type of encoding.
